# Nova
**INTRODUCTION**  
This project (Nova) involves the design and development of a GUI centric mock university website using core web technologies. The website is designed to visually simulate a real university portal, emphasizing *layout structure, visual hierarchy, consistency, and intuitive navigation*. Rather than prioritizing backend functionality, the project concentrates on how users perceive, navigate, and interact with a digital academic environment. The GUI acts as the primary medium through which information such as courses, admissions, and institutional details are communicated, ensuring clarity, accessibility, and aesthetic balance. *Nova* acts as a practical sandbox for experimenting with UI/UX design and browser-based logic, all without external frameworks. 

***The objectives of this project are:***  
  1) To design a visually engaging, emotionally resonant and user-friendly GUI for an academic website.
  2) To apply GUI principles such as alignment, contrast, spacing, and consistency.
  3) To apply UI/UX principles that enhance user immersion and engagement.
  4) To strengthen frontend development skills using core web technologies.
  5) To present academic, cultural, historical, and institutional information in a coherent and intuitive manner.
  6) To simulate how a university communicates its mission, departments, campus life, alumni, and student community through digital media.

**METHODOLOGY**  
The development process follows a *GUI-first approach*, where interface design decisions guide implementation.
  1. GUI Design Phase
      1. Identification of primary user flows (browsing courses, admissions, contact).
      2. Creation of layout wireframes focusing on visual hierarchy
      3. Selection of color schemes and typography suitable for educational platforms

  2. Implementation Phase  
     *Tech Stack:*  
           1. HTML5: Semantic structure for GUI components such as headers, navigation bars, cards, and forms  
           2. CSS3: Styling and layout using Flexbox and Grid to ensure responsive and visually balanced interfaces  
           3. JavaScript: Enables client-side interactivity for GUI elements including:  
               1) Navigation menu toggling  
               2) Interactive buttons and hover states  
               3) Form validation feedback  
               4) Dynamic content rendering    
                  
The GUI is designed to be responsive, ensuring consistent user experience across devices and screen sizes.
